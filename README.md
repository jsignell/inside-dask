# Dask Binder template

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jrbourbeau/dask-binder-template/main?urlpath=lab)

A template for Dask-enabled repositories for use on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). Specifically, this template ensures that Dask and [Dask's JupyterLab extension](https://github.com/dask/dask-labextension) are installed and configured for use on mybinder.org.

## How to use

1. Click the "Use this template" button
2. Change files in the ``binder/`` directory to customize your Jupyter environment
3. Add new notebooks
4. Change the ![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg) button URL below to point to your repository (i.e. change `jrbourbeau/dask-binder-template` to your repository)
5. Share with your friends and colleagues!

This template was inspired by [Pangeo's binder template](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-binder-template) and my own need to repeatedly create repositories with Dask's JupyterLab extension configured.
